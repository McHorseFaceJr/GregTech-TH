Here's the basic overview of the modpack as an idea:
You're a Time Lord, and your TARDIS has been caught in a crack in the fabric of reality. This crack opened while the TARDIS was traveling through the Time Vortex, 
pulling you into an alternate reality. Your TARDIS was destroyed, and now you have to grow a new TARDIS. The problem is that you have no way to do this as of yet. 
You must progress through the ages of technology to obtain your TARDIS. To get to this goal, you must travel to far-off worlds, become a wizard, and thrust yourself into your 
imagination to have the most efficient factory and energy system in the cosmos. Pretty much, there are going to be plenty of quests with 𝔤𝔯𝔞𝔫𝔡𝔦𝔬𝔰𝔢 language, neat multiblocks, 
plenty of custom recipes (balanced), magic, and some more of that 𝒿𝒶𝓏𝓏 to make it realistic yet fun. Prepare to be bombarded with references to plenty of sci-fi and potentially—extremely probable—real life.
